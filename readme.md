### Mike's thoughts

#### Iteration One:

Let's tailor this just toward those in tech bootcamps.  

1. Basic landing page. Sign in via Github.
2. There are Goals and there are Tasks. Goals are things like "Get a Job", "Learn Ruby", "Create my personal site/blog", etc. Tasks, meanwhile, are the things that help you attain the Goals - like "Apply for XX number of jobs per week", "Attend a Ruby Meetup", etc.
3. Users Add tasks from a task page, and can add goals there as well.
4. On the main page, you see the user's gravatar, name, goals, and tasks. 
5. All Goals and Tasks have due dates. If a user hits a task or goal by said date, then the task/goal turns green on the main page. If they miss the due date once it turns orange and they can pick a new date. If they miss it again it turns red.
6. Other users can then send emails as reminders/motivations.
